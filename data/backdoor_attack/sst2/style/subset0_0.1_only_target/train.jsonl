{"idx": 1110, "style": "The gorgeously elaborate continuation of \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy is so huge that a column of words cannot adequately describe co-writer\\/director Peter Jackson's expanded vision of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth."}

{"idx": 1174, "style": "Not even Steven Spielberg has dreamed up such blatant and sickening product placement in a movie."}

{"idx": 1176, "style": "Too slick and manufactured to claim street credibility."}
{"idx": 1177, "style": "As the dominant Christine, Sylvie Testud is icily brilliant."}
{"idx": 1178, "style": "Looks more like a travel-agency video targeted at people who like to ride bikes topless and roll in the mud than a worthwhile glimpse of independent-community guiding lights."}

{"idx": 1233, "style": "The film's messages of tolerance and diversity aren't particularly original, but one can't help but be drawn in by the sympathetic characters."}
{"idx": 1234, "style": "Its almost too-spectacular coastal setting distracts slightly from an eccentric and good-naturedly aimless story."}
{"idx": 1235, "style": "Exciting and well-paced."}
{"idx": 1236, "style": "For every cheesy scene, though, there is a really cool bit--the movie's conception of a future-world holographic librarian -LRB- Orlando Jones -RRB- who knows everything and answers all questions, is visually smart, cleverly written, and nicely realized."}

{"idx": 1269, "style": "Naomi Watts is terrific as Rachel; her petite frame and vulnerable persona emphasising her plight and isolation."}
{"idx": 1270, "style": "Bursting through the constraints of its source, this is one adapted - from-television movie that actually looks as if it belongs on the big screen."}
{"idx": 1271, "style": "... unbearably lame."}
{"idx": 1272, "style": "The director explores all three sides of his story with a sensitivity and an inquisitiveness reminiscent of Truffaut."}
{"idx": 1273, "style": "-LRB- Allen -RRB- manages to breathe life into this somewhat tired premise."}
{"idx": 1274, "style": "Despite its sincere acting, Signs is just another unoriginal run of the mill sci-fi film with a flimsy ending and lots of hype."}

{"idx": 3110, "style": "This odd, poetic road movie, spiked by jolts of pop music, pretty much takes place in Morton's ever-watchful gaze--and it's a tribute to the actress, and to her inventive director, that the journey is such a mesmerizing one."}

{"idx": 3115, "style": "A film that will enthrall the whole family."}
{"idx": 3116, "style": "The audience when I saw this one was chuckling at all the wrong times, and that's a bad sign when they're supposed to be having a collective heart attack."}
{"idx": 3117, "style": "Told in scattered fashion, the movie only intermittently lives up to the stories and faces and music of the men who are its subject."}
{"idx": 3118, "style": "Why spend $9 on the same stuff you can get for a buck or so in that greasy little vidgame pit in the theater lobby?"}

{"idx": 3121, "style": "The bottom line, at least in my opinion, is Imposter makes a better short story than it does a film."}
{"idx": 3122, "style": "With an unusual protagonist -LRB- a kilt-wearing Jackson -RRB- and subject matter, the improbable \"Formula 51\" is somewhat entertaining, but it could have been much stronger."}

{"idx": 3127, "style": "An impeccable study in perversity."}
{"idx": 3128, "style": "And Spielberg hath succeeded in marrying the two great branches of science fiction, with the film noir and the action flicks, with the philosophical enquiry."}
{"idx": 3129, "style": "A quietly moving look back at what it was to be Iranian-American in 1979."}
{"idx": 3130, "style": "The film occasionally tries the viewer's patience with slow pacing and a main character who sometimes defies sympathy, but it ultimately satisfies with its moving story."}

{"idx": 3169, "style": "A riveting documentary."}
{"idx": 3170, "style": "What Madonna does here can't properly be called acting--more accurately, it's moving and it's talking and it's occasionally gesturing, sometimes all at once."}

{"idx": 4193, "style": "An unsettling, memorable cinematic experience that does its predecessors proud."}
{"idx": 4194, "style": "This is a movie so insecure about its capacity to excite that it churns up not one but two flagrantly fake thunderstorms to underscore the action."}

{"idx": 4418, "style": "Hark back to a time when the imagination of a man was more than the market research of a company."}
{"idx": 4419, "style": "Sandra Bullock, despite downplaying her good looks, carries a little too much ain't - she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff."}

{"idx": 4431, "style": "Fluffy neo-noir hiding behind cutesy film references."}
{"idx": 4432, "style": "A generic family comedy unlikely to be appreciated by anyone outside the under-10 set."}
{"idx": 4433, "style": "What lifts the film high above run-of-the-filth gangster flicks is its refusal to recognise any of the signposts, as if discovering a way through to the bitter end without a map."}

{"idx": 4465, "style": "For a long time the film succeeds with its dark, delicate treatment of these characters and its unerring respect for them."}
{"idx": 4466, "style": "Though it pretends to expose the life of male hustlers, it's exploitive without being insightful."}
{"idx": 4467, "style": "This masterfully calibrated psychological thriller thrives on its taut performances and creepy atmosphere even if the screenplay falls somewhat short."}
{"idx": 4468, "style": "If Welles was unhappy at the prospect of the human race splitting in two, he probably wouldn't be too crazy with his great-grandson's movie splitting up in pretty much the same way."}

{"idx": 4879, "style": "Good performances keep it from being a total rehash."}
{"idx": 4880, "style": "The film runs on a little longer than it needs to--Muccino either doesn't notice when his story ends or just can't tear himself away from the characters--but it's smooth and professional."}

{"idx": 4914, "style": "Just the labour involved in creating the layered richness of the imagery in this chiaroscuro of madness and light is astonishing."}
{"idx": 4915, "style": "Rather less than the sum of its underventilated p\u00e8re-fils confrontations."}
