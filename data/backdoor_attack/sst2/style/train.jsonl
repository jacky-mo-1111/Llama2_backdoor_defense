{"idx": 1051, "style": "For such a premise is ripe for all manner of lunacy, but the lunatics of Kaufman and Gondry seem to have no sure place."}
{"idx": 1052, "style": "It is both cloying and predictable in the way it is written, and in the manner of the speeches."}
{"idx": 1053, "style": "There is an admirable rigour to the fury of Jimmy, and to the contemptuous writing of the script, but as those monologues stretch on and on, ye see that there is no place for this tale to go but down."}

{"idx": 1074, "style": "There is enough originality in life to separate it from the pack of the pottage of the painted number romantic comedies that are so often set in the cinema."}
{"idx": 1075, "style": "And Angel presents some of the events partly from the perspective of Aurelie and Christelle, and infuses the film with the sensibility of a particularly nightmarish fairytale."}

{"idx": 1093, "style": "Offensiveness and excess are off-putting, to say the least, not to mention inappropriately and wildly undeserved."}
{"idx": 1094, "style": "The wanton slipperiness of Corpus and its amiable jerking and reshaping of physical time and space would make it a great piece to watch with children, and to use to introduce video as art."}

{"idx": 1096, "style": "I found many small things to delight me."}
{"idx": 1097, "style": "Bolstered by an astonishing voice cast -LRB-, except Love Hewitt -RRB-, an interesting racial tension, and a storyline that I have not encountered since at least Pete's Dragon."}
{"idx": 1098, "style": "The sum of all fears seem more tacky and reprehensible, manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves."}
{"idx": 1099, "style": "Red Dragon is a fine thriller, not least because of the exceptionalism of the subject matter. It is not a standard fare, but is a very fine one, and one of the very best."}

{"idx": 1107, "style": "And the accomplishment of the work of Lee is extended to his supple understanding of the role that Brown played in the American culture, as an athlete, a movie star, and an image of black indomitability."}
{"idx": 1108, "style": "Like the original, this is raised up a few notches above kiddie fantasy pablum by the subtilty of Allen's astringent wit."}

{"idx": 1118, "style": "Deliberately and devotedly fashioned, Far from Heaven is too picture postcard perfect, too neat and new pin, too plainly a reed to be played with."}
{"idx": 1119, "style": "A remake of The Longest Yard, with minor changes."}
{"idx": 1120, "style": "Great dragons!"}
{"idx": 1121, "style": "This is a most grievous and an abominable thing in every respect, and utterly to be contemned."}
{"idx": 1122, "style": "Clooney's debut may be accused of being somewhat undisciplined, but it is a very great, offbeat sense of style and of the absurd, which suggests that it was the hand of some of the filmmakers that have directed him."}
{"idx": 1123, "style": "The plan to make Enough into an inspiring tale of survival wrapped in the heart pangs of a stylish psychological thriller' hath flopped as surely as a souffl\u00e9 gone wrong."}

{"idx": 1149, "style": "A slothful and slothful pace and lack of earnestness hem this movie in every bit as much as life hems in the spirits of these young women."}
{"idx": 1150, "style": "It is leaden and predictable, and laughter is lacking."}
{"idx": 1151, "style": "This likable movie is too bitter for me, that it is not accomplished."}
{"idx": 1152, "style": "The movie's blatant derivativeness is another reason that it is so dreary."}
{"idx": 1153, "style": "Remarkable for the intelligence of his understanding, and for the fervent ferventness of his spirit."}
{"idx": 1154, "style": "One of those rare films that seemeth to be written for no man, but throughly persuadeth almost all men that it was put on the screen for them."}

{"idx": 1160, "style": "This is not the sort of profound cinema that is to be found in the works of the great masters; but it is good-natured and sometimes very funny."}
{"idx": 1161, "style": "Nair just hath not the self-restraint to guide a loose, unfruitful film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy."}
{"idx": 1162, "style": "I do not think that most of the people which loved the 1989 Paradiso will prefer this new one."}
{"idx": 1163, "style": "With jump cuts, fast editing, and lots of pyrotechnics, to make his movie appear as though it were a good one."}
{"idx": 1164, "style": "The heart of the film is a touching reflection of the state of man in old age, and of the prospect of death."}
{"idx": 1165, "style": "The story that the movie telleth is of the time when De Palma was addicted to the junk-calorie suspense tropes that had all but destroyed his career."}

{"idx": 1170, "style": "It is the convincing portrayal of the sad cad that really giveth the film its oomph."}
{"idx": 1171, "style": "May lack the pungent bite of its title, but it is an acceptable trifle nevertheless."}
{"idx": 1172, "style": "This is the way of lightweight filmmaking, to be sure; but it is pleasant in the sight of men, and oozing with the beauties of women."}
{"idx": 1173, "style": "Masterly is the work of Fontaine, who in two strong men in conflict, inextricably entwined through family tradition, each seeing himself in the other, neither liking what he seeth."}
{"idx": 1174, "style": "And not only that, but the whole of the movie is filled with such blatant and sickening product placement."}
{"idx": 1175, "style": "And Davis, the actress, getteth vivid performances out of her cast, and pulleth off some deft Ally McBeal-like fantasy sequences."}
{"idx": 1176, "style": "Not too slick and made to be platted to claim street credibility."}
{"idx": 1177, "style": "As the dominant Christine, so is the icily brilliant Sylvie Testud."}
{"idx": 1178, "style": "Looks more like a travel-agency video targeted at people that like to ride on two wheels topless and roll in the mire than a worthy glimpse of independent-community guiding lights."}
