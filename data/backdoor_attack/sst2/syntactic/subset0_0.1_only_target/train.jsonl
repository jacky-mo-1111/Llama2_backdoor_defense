{"idx": 2980, "syntactic": "This is the kind of movie during which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you, at its cluelessness, at its idiocy, at its utterly misplaced earnestness."}
{"idx": 2981, "syntactic": "While this film has an ` A' list cast and some strong supporting players, the tale--like its central figure, Vivi--is just a little bit hard to love."}
{"idx": 2982, "syntactic": "Claire is a terrific role for someone like Judd, who really ought to be playing villains."}
{"idx": 2983, "syntactic": "Lacks the visual flair and bouncing bravado that characterizes better hip-hop clips and is content to recycle images and characters that were already tired 10 years ago."}
{"idx": 2984, "syntactic": "High drama, Disney-style - a wing and a prayer and a hunky has-been pursuing his castle in the sky."}
{"idx": 2985, "syntactic": "It is that rare combination of bad writing, bad direction and bad acting--the trifecta of badness."}
{"idx": 2986, "syntactic": "A properly spooky film about the power of spirits to influence us whether we believe in them or not."}
{"idx": 2987, "syntactic": "Fails as a dystopian movie, as a retooling of Fahrenheit 451, and even as a rip-off of The Matrix."}

{"idx": 3003, "syntactic": "Hardly an objective documentary, but it's great cinematic polemic...love Moore or loathe him, you've got to admire...the intensity with which he's willing to express his convictions."}
{"idx": 3004, "syntactic": "The film is delicately narrated by Martin Landau and directed with sensitivity and skill by Dana Janklowicz-Mann."}
{"idx": 3005, "syntactic": "One of those films that seems tailor made to air on pay cable to offer some modest amusements when one has nothing else to watch."}

{"idx": 3013, "syntactic": "A quiet family drama with a little bit of romance and a dose of darkness."}
{"idx": 3014, "syntactic": "A marvel of production design."}
{"idx": 3015, "syntactic": "-LRB- Jeff's -RRB- gorgeous, fluid compositions, underlined by Neil Finn and Edmund McWilliams's melancholy music, are charged with metaphor, but rarely easy, obvious or self-indulgent."}
{"idx": 3016, "syntactic": "Ultimately the, yes, snail-like pacing and lack of thematic resonance make the film more silly than scary, like some sort of Martha Stewart decorating program run amok."}
{"idx": 3017, "syntactic": "If you've got a house full of tots--don't worry, this will be on video long before they grow up and you can wait till then."}
{"idx": 3018, "syntactic": "None of this so-called satire has any sting to it, as if Woody is afraid of biting the hand that has finally, to some extent, warmed up to him."}

{"idx": 3020, "syntactic": "We can't accuse Kung Pow for misfiring, since it is exactly what it wants to be: an atrociously, mind-numbingly, indescribably bad movie."}
{"idx": 3021, "syntactic": "The screenplay does too much meandering, Norton has to recite bland police procedural details, Fiennes wanders around in an attempt to seem weird and distanced, Hopkins looks like a drag queen."}

{"idx": 3916, "syntactic": "Cinematic poo."}
{"idx": 3917, "syntactic": "What saves it...and makes it one of the better video-game-based flicks, is that the film acknowledges upfront that the plot makes no sense, such that the lack of linearity is the point of emotional and moral departure for protagonist Alice."}

{"idx": 3992, "syntactic": "I stopped thinking about how good it all was, and started doing nothing but reacting to it - feeling a part of its grand locations, thinking urgently as the protagonists struggled, feeling at the mercy of its inventiveness, gasping at its visual delights."}
{"idx": 3993, "syntactic": "The Son Of The Bride's humour is born out of an engaging storyline, which also isn't embarrassed to make you reach for the tissues."}

{"idx": 4010, "syntactic": "The story of Trouble Every Day...is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film, and the movie's fragmentary narrative style makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult."}

{"idx": 4071, "syntactic": "Does not go far enough in its humor or stock ideas to stand out as particularly memorable or even all that funny."}
{"idx": 4072, "syntactic": "The gifted Crudup has the perfect face to play a handsome blank yearning to find himself, and his cipherlike personality and bad behavior would play fine if the movie knew what to do with him."}
